### Resistor Network Calculator

When I needed to manage over 20+ switches in one of my electronic projects, 
I opted for resistor networks instead of the row-column method for reading the switches
You can read the complete article [here](https://the-this-pointer.github.io/blog/resistor-network-for-keypad-calculation.html).

The `res values.png` file is from [this link](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/439987/how-to-figure-out-what-resistors-are-in-the-e12-and-e24-series).

The `sample_output.txt` is the output result for a 4x5 keypad, and the table you see in the file is calculations for the resistor values based on the image `matrix.png` (The image itself is for a 4x4 keypad). As you see the final ADC gap for this type of keypad is 25.
